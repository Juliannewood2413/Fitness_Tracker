# Fitness_Tracker

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

- This assignment required building out an application that uses MongoDB and Mongoose to create an interactive workout tracker. The user can create a new workout, continue previous workouts, or view stats dashboard to view their progress.
